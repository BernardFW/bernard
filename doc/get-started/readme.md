Get Started
===========

Here's a quick code sample:

```python
import bernard

def main():
    print('Not so fast!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Well I'm sorry, this is a trick. No 3-liner can ever cover how to make
a bot with BERNARD. You have to bear in mind that doing bots is a
**brand new craft** that you need to learn. When we asked COBOL
developers to build websites, it was a disaster. Do you remember when
JavaScript was only used to make snow fall at Christmas time? In fact,
it took up until a few years to find what are the required skills and
tools to build a website. The same thing is happening with bots: it's a
new craft that nobody masters yet. It's up to all of us to build it!

This introduction to BERNARD is a walk-trough the basic features of the
framework and intends to give you the techniques that BERNARD authors
think are right. From here on, concepts and theory will be explained as
general truth but keep in mind that it's just a point of view.

## Summary

There is several parts, which are all pretty important and most of the
concepts and techniques here are unrelated to most things you've ever
seen in web development. You might want to skip the "Finite State
Machine" part if you already know what it is. Also if you want to get
your hands on, you can start by the "Simple Bot" first and read things
backward if you don't understand it instinctively.
